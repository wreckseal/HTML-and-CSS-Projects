# HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
- [Space Station Site](https://github.com/wreckseal/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Space-Station)
- [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/wreckseal/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Bootstrap4_Project)

### Space Station Site
This is an example home page for a Space Travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie Theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
